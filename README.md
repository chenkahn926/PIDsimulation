# PIDsimulation

This is a simulation program for evaluating DDoS attacks in future Internet.

You can complie InterestLuringSim.c or BotCoopSim.c using gcc to generate a.out.

Then you can run the corresponding scripts (.sh files) to run the simulation.

The simulation input files and parameters have already been contained in the .sh files.

For InterestLuringSim.sh:
    ./a.out [Topology File] [Edge ASes] [No. of Luring ASes] [Attack Mode] [No. of Tempted ASes] [No. of Attack ASes]
    
For BotCoopSim.sh:
    ./a.out [Topology File] [Edge ASes] [No. of Bot ASes]
